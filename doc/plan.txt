For the first phase of developement we would like to visualize the point on Q-lines algorithm
To visualize, we will:
 - plot all lines
 - Choose k lines and search for boundary solutions
    - create setes for each regions
 - Recursively search through sets:
    - dull out all other lines and emphasize certain lines
    - may be helpful to have a zoom in or zoom out animation. Could accomplish this with a "zoomed_inset_axes"
 - Stop when we find a Q intersection

 - The visualization should be reflective of what the algorithm is doing

 How do we want to create this solution?
 - If we ignore the visualization for a moment we would want methods such as:
    - Solve classically
    - Constructing the graphs with k lines **
    - Construct s(R_i) and search for boundary solution
 - Visually we need to represent:
    - Solving classically
    - Constructing s(R_i) and searching for boundary solutions
    - Making the recursion obvious visually

New plan:
- First implement DCEL data structure
- Then implement arrangement construction
- Then implement finding Q-intersection (could add to DCEL data structure)
- Then implement constructing regions
- Then implement recursion

We will have Q-lines class and a DCEL class and maybe a line class
